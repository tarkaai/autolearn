# Skill Composition Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Skills can now call other skills using the `call_skill()` function. This enables powerful skill composition where complex functionality can be built by combining simpler, reusable skills.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Core Infrastructure (`backend/skill_engine.py`)

**New `SkillContext` Class:**
- Manages execution context for skills with access to other skills
- Tracks call stack to prevent circular dependencies
- Enforces maximum call depth (default: 5 levels)
- Provides `call_skill(name, **kwargs)` function injected into skill execution

**Updated `SkillEngine` Class:**
- New `_run_with_context()` method for context-aware execution
- Updated `run()` method to create fresh execution contexts
- Each skill execution gets its own isolated context with call stack tracking

### 2. Sandbox Integration (`backend/sandbox.py`)

**Updated `run_skill_sandboxed()` Function:**
- Now accepts optional `skill_context` parameter
- Injects `call_skill()` function into skill's global namespace
- Maintains backward compatibility with skills that don't use composition

### 3. AI Skill Generation (`backend/openai_client.py`)

**Enhanced System Prompts:**
- Documents `call_skill()` API with examples
- Encourages AI to compose existing skills rather than reimplementing
- Provides clear usage patterns for skill composition

### 4. Consumer Agent (`backend/consumer_agent.py`)

**Enhanced Skill Generation:**
- Better context about available skills when generating new ones
- Includes parameter information and usage examples
- Explicitly instructs AI to use `call_skill()` when appropriate

## Key Features

### 1. Basic Skill Composition
Skills can call other skills to build complex functionality:

```python
def compound_formula(x: float, y: float, z: float) -> dict:
    """Calculate (x * 2) + (y * 3) + z using calculator skill."""
    step1 = call_skill('calculator', operation='multiply', a=x, b=2.0)
    step2 = call_skill('calculator', operation='multiply', a=y, b=3.0)
    result = call_skill('calculator', operation='add', a=step1['result'], b=step2['result'])
    return {'result': result['result']}
```

### 2. Circular Dependency Detection
The system automatically detects and prevents circular dependencies:

```python
# Skill A calls Skill B, Skill B calls Skill A
# This will be detected and raise: SkillRuntimeError with "Circular dependency detected"
```

### 3. Maximum Depth Prevention
Prevents runaway recursion with configurable max depth (default: 5):

```python
# If skill chain exceeds depth limit:
# A -> B -> C -> D -> E -> F (6 levels)
# Raises: SkillRuntimeError with "Max call depth exceeded"
```

### 4. Error Propagation
Errors from called skills propagate correctly through the call stack with full context.

### 5. Backward Compatibility
Skills without `call_skill()` continue to work normally - the feature is opt-in.

## Testing

### Unit Tests (`tests/unit/skill_composition.py`)
13 comprehensive test cases covering:
- Basic skill calling
- Multiple skill composition
- Circular dependency prevention (direct and indirect)
- Max depth prevention
- Error propagation
- Backward compatibility
- Complex composition scenarios

**Result:** All 13 tests passing ✓

### Integration Tests (`tests/integration/skill_chaining.py`)
Integration tests covering:
- MCP protocol with composite skills
- Circular dependency detection via MCP
- Deep skill chains via MCP
- AI-generated skill composition
- Consumer agent skill composition
- Error handling in nested calls

### Demonstration (`demo_skill_composition.py`)
Working demonstration showing:
- Basic composition (calculator → compound_formula)
- Multi-level chaining (multiply → square → sum_of_squares)
- Circular dependency prevention
- Depth limit enforcement

**Result:** All demonstrations working correctly ✓

## Usage Examples

### For Skill Developers

When writing skills manually, use `call_skill()` to leverage existing skills:

```python
def pythagorean_theorem(a: float, b: float) -> dict:
    """Calculate hypotenuse using existing square and add skills."""
    a_squared = call_skill('square', x=a)
    b_squared = call_skill('square', x=b)
    sum_squares = call_skill('add', a=a_squared['result'], b=b_squared['result'])
    
    import math
    hypotenuse = math.sqrt(sum_squares['result'])
    
    return {'hypotenuse': hypotenuse, 'formula': 'sqrt(a² + b²)'}
```

### For AI-Generated Skills

The AI will automatically use skill composition when appropriate:

```
User: "Create a skill that calculates the area of a circle"

AI generates (if a multiply skill exists):
def circle_area(radius: float) -> dict:
    """Calculate circle area using multiply skill."""
    import math
    pi_times_r = call_skill('multiply', a=math.pi, b=radius)
    area = call_skill('multiply', a=pi_times_r['result'], b=radius)
    return {'area': area['result']}
```

### Via MCP Protocol

Skills with composition work seamlessly through MCP:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "compound_formula",
    "arguments": {"x": 5, "y": 3, "z": 7}
  }
}
```

## Architecture

```
User Request
    ↓
SkillEngine.run()
    ↓

    ↓
sandbox.run_skill_sandboxed()
    ↓
Inject call_skill() into skill globals
    ↓
Execute Skill
    ↓ (if skill calls another skill)
call_skill('other_skill', args...)
    ↓
SkillContext.call_skill()
    ↓
Check circular dependency
Check max depth
    ↓
SkillEngine._run_with_context() (with extended call stack)
    ↓

    ↓
[repeat for nested calls]
```

## Safety Guarantees

1. **Circular Dependency Prevention:** No skill can call itself directly or indirectly
2. **Depth Limiting:** Maximum of 5 nested skill calls by default
3. **Error Isolation:** Errors in called skills are caught and properly wrapped
4. **Call Stack Tracking:** Full visibility into the chain of skill calls for debugging

## Performance Considerations

- Each skill call adds minimal overhead (context creation, stack checking)
- Call stack is lightweight (just skill names)
- No serialization overhead (in-process calls)
- Suitable for production use with reasonable depth limits

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements (not implemented):
- Configurable max depth per skill or globally
- Skill dependency graph visualization
- Caching of skill call results
- Parallel skill execution for independent calls
- Skill call metrics and monitoring

## Files Modified

1. `backend/skill_engine.py` - Added SkillContext, updated run logic
2. `backend/sandbox.py` - Added context injection
3. `backend/openai_client.py` - Enhanced prompts
4. `backend/consumer_agent.py` - Better skill context for generation

## Files Created

1. `tests/unit/skill_composition.py` - Comprehensive unit tests
2. `tests/integration/skill_chaining.py` - Integration tests
3. `demo_skill_composition.py` - Working demonstration
4. `SKILL_COMPOSITION_SUMMARY.md` - This document

## Conclusion

The skill composition feature is fully implemented, tested, and ready for use. Skills can now build upon each other to create complex functionality while maintaining safety through circular dependency detection and depth limiting.
